## ðŸ§± Scalability & Future Enhancements

This project is designed with modular and object-oriented principles, making it easily **scalable**. You can enhance or scale it using:

- **SQLite or MySQL integration** via **JDBC** for persistent database storage.
- **JavaFX or Swing** for a graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Spring Boot or Jakarta EE** to convert it into a full-fledged web application.
- **File I/O** using CSV, JSON, or Java serialization for simple local storage.
- **JUnit Testing** for adding unit tests and integrating with CI/CD pipelines.

These improvements can evolve the project from a basic CLI tool into a robust, production-ready system.
